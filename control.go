// This file is jobd controlling jobd: start it in the background, stop it, and
// say whether one is running.
//
// It lives in the tool rather than in a shell script on purpose. A script would
// have to open supervisor.json and pick the pid out of the JSON — reaching
// through the abstraction into the file binding, which is the thing this project
// spends its time removing. jobd already owns that file. A script would also
// only run on the machine it was written for, and the other end of this chain is
// a Linux NAS.

// supervisorPID returns the process id of the supervisor watching this store,
// and whether it is alive.
//
// The heartbeat carries owner as "program@host:pid". Trusting the pid alone
// would be wrong across machines — a NAS supervisor's pid means nothing here —
// so the host has to match before the number is worth anything.
